# CMPUT-301---Assignment-1

This assignment contains a folder to run an Android Project for Assignment 1 of CMPUT 301

FeelsBook is an app that lets you record one of 6 feelings and view a history of them by date after recording. Unfortunately, due to other assignments, I ran out of time in making this assignment and was not able to complete everything needed, so I thought I would make a list of what was done to make it easier for marking...

Things that were done:
  - Each record of a feeling has an emotion, timestamp, and comment (comment is not visible, and cannot be accessed as intended, but is       tied to the data.
  - Quickly record an emotion with only 1 click on the app and add an optional comment.
  - Browse and view the history of emotions.
  - History list is ordered by time
  - App assists in correct user input (with the exception of comments being larger then 100 characters)
  - App is persistent. 
  - Video
  
Things that were not done:
  - See a count of each emotion recorded
  - View and edit the details of past emotions
  - Delete a past emotion
  - UML Diagram
  
  All work was done on my own, pulling from concepts learnt in the lab and using the Lab 2 code as a base for mine. To create the pop up window, this URL was used to learn how it worked https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlertDialog.Builder
